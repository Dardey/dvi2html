# DVI Parser

The goal with this project is to eventually have a complete DVI toolset
written in node, something that would allow for implementations of TeX
document conversion to be written as node plugins.

### TODO
- [x] DVI Parser
- [ ] TFM Parser
- [ ] Metric management (right now, fonts are assumed to be in mactex's default location)
